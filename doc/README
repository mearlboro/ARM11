Hello guys.

- Please ctrl+F “TODO” to see what’s left TO DO. (There is still a lot left TO DO)

- Code compiles without -pedantic flag. This is only provisory. With -pedantic
  it complains about stuff which will no longer be present in the source once all the
  TODOs are done so don’t worry about it. The Makefile now has no -pedantic flag. We’ll
  add it back when we’re finished.

- The code still needs debugging but partly works for the stuff that’s been 
  implemented. I would suggest that you just pull my branch (TestBranch) because it is the 
  most up-to-date and merging now would be very painful and a waste of time. 
  So we can all work on the same, compiling, assemble.c file and eventually merge on master.

- You will find that I have changed how files and directories are organised. I made a lot 
  of changes generally to get the code to compile. Please don’t be upset if you found that I 
  changed your code. This is not definitive and everything is up for debate. I moved stuff
  around and organised stuff as *I* thought was best. Please prove me wrong.

- You will find that I have written a ton of comments, like really a lot of them. 
  Hopefully you’ll find them useful.
  Please read the comments because everything will be clear if you do. There I explain what 
  I’ve done and what is left to do.

- Pick whichever TODO’s you prefer and work on them.

- For debugging, whenever an assembly line is
  assembled and the binary word/instruction computed, it is printed in LITTLE ENDIAN with its
  address in memory. So IF THE CODE WORKS what is printed to the terminal IS EXACTLY what you would
  see if you “xxd -b -c4” the appropriate binary file. 

- At the current state we have a two-pass assembly… I know shame on me but I really needed to get it
  running as quickly as possible. Once we finish we can consider doing it in one pass (not so 
  straightforward believe me). If you want to understand what’s going on read lib/assembler.c also
  the long comments at the end of the file even thought they are confusing.

- So now just pull/clone TestBranch and start working on the TODO’s. Good Luck I’ve been awake for 30 
  hours now I’m going to bed.
